## Codex execution

Codex executes plans from `plans/<task>.md`. Read the whole plan first and follow
its steps and acceptance criteria. If a step is wrong or impossible, stop and
report it; do not silently diverge from the plan.

After each phase, report the files changed. Never commit: the user commits by hand. Codex runs the phase's gate. Claude
runs the project's full checks (typecheck, lint, build) afterward in the background,
so Codex doesn't need to run those unless the gate names them.

### Full plan execution (when asked "Execute plans/<task>.md")

This is the default handoff: the user pastes one line, and you run the whole plan in
this session. `.codex/autopilot.js` does the snapshots, gates, Claude verification and
the task summary; you do the implementation and the fixes.

1. `node .codex/autopilot.js check plans/<task>.md`. If it isn't runnable, stop and
   report the problems. Then `node .codex/autopilot.js begin plans/<task>.md`.
2. If `begin` says plan review is on, do the "Plan review" below (append
   `## Codex Findings` only), then run `node .codex/autopilot.js triage plans/<task>.md`
   and re-read the plan: Claude may have added phases or changed gates.
3. For each phase, in document order (including phases like "Phase 2.5"):
   1. `node .codex/autopilot.js phase plans/<task>.md <N>`
   2. Implement the phase following "Phase execution" below.
   3. `node .codex/autopilot.js verify plans/<task>.md <N>`, then act on its exit code:
      - **0 (PASS):** go to the next phase.
      - **2 (gate failed):** fix the failure within the phase, then run verify again.
      - **3 (NEEDS REWORK):** the output includes `.codex/verify/alignment.md`. Fix every
        MISSING and PARTIAL item and undo every OUT OF SCOPE change, within the phase.
        If a finding is about code the phase didn't touch, leave it and say so. Then run
        verify again.
      - **1 or 4 (failed or stuck):** stop and report the reason the command printed.
4. `node .codex/autopilot.js close plans/<task>.md`. It runs `graphify update .` and has
   Claude write `docs/tasks/<date>-<task>.md`.
5. End your reply with: `Task <task> done. Review and commit the changes.`

Rules for this mode:
- Don't stop between phases to ask; keep going until `close`, a failure or a stuck run.
- `verify`, `triage` and `close` start headless Claude runs: they need network access
  and take several minutes. Run them with a long timeout (30 minutes) and request
  permission to run outside the sandbox if the sandbox blocks them.
- Don't write `.codex/verify/phase.json` and don't run `graphify update` yourself; the
  helper does both.
- To pick up after a failure or a stuck run, run the step that failed again (for
  example `verify` for the same phase) once the cause is fixed.

### Phase execution

- **Never run `git commit`, `git add`, `git stash` or `git push`.** The user commits by
  hand. Leave every change in the working tree, including earlier phases' work and the
  verify run's fixes.
- Do exactly one phase per turn. Stop after it. Do not start the next phase.
- Before editing, read only the files the phase lists. Use graphify for anything else.
- Run the phase gate. If it fails, fix it within the phase. If you cannot, stop and say why.
- Do not change files outside the phase scope. If you need to, stop and report it.
- **Single-phase mode** (asked "Execute phase <N> of plans/<task>.md"): the steps below
  this one apply only here, not in a full plan execution.
- When the phase is done, write `.codex/verify/phase.json` with
  `{ "plan": "plans/<task>.md", "phase": "<N>" }`, so the verify run knows which phase
  to review.
- Run `graphify update .` once at the end of the phase.
- End your reply with: `Phase <N> done. Gate: <command> -> <pass/fail>.`
- **Full plan execution and autopilot runs** (the prompt says "Autopilot run"): skip
  `phase.json`, `graphify update` and the end line above. `.codex/autopilot.js` runs the
  gate and the verification, and runs graphify at the end.
- Treat accepted Codex Findings as part of the plan. Execute intermediate phases
  (for example "Phase 2.5") in order.

### Plan review (when asked "Review plans/<task>.md")

- Do not edit or reorder existing phases.
- Do not edit app code.
- Append a section `## Codex Findings` at the end of the plan.
- For each finding: the phase it affects, what is wrong or missing, evidence (file path
  or graphify result), and a proposed fix.
- If a phase needs a prerequisite step, propose an intermediate phase (for example
  "Phase 2.5") inside the findings. Do not renumber existing phases.
- Check specifically: files that do not exist, missed dependents (use `graphify query`),
  missing test gates, unclear acceptance criteria, risky ordering.
- End with: `PLAN REVIEW: APPROVE | CHANGES NEEDED`.

For UI work, use the impeccable skill and follow `PRODUCT.md` and `DESIGN.md`. Run any
impeccable command the plan names. Never commit impeccable's live-mode block
(`impeccable-live-start` … `impeccable-live-end`).

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

When the user types `/graphify`, use the installed graphify skill or instructions before doing anything else.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- Dirty graphify-out/ files are expected after hooks or incremental updates; dirty graph files are not a reason to skip graphify. Only skip graphify if the task is about stale or incorrect graph output, or the user explicitly says not to use it.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
- After all code edits for a task are complete, run `graphify update .` once at the end
  of the coding session. Do not run it between file edits.
